# Ask-PDF GPT

A Next.js application that allows users to upload PDFs, convert their content into vector embeddings, and interact with the document using AI-powered chat. The app utilizes **Cohere** for embeddings, **Pinecone** for storing namespaces, and **Vercel Blob** for storage. The app is deployed on **Vercel**.

## Features
- Upload PDF files
- Convert content into vector embeddings (using **Cohereâ€™s embeddingV3**)
- AI-powered chat to interact with documents (using **Command R+** for generating responses)
- Store embeddings in **Pinecone** namespaces
